## Why did I build it? ü§î

- Monarch/Monaco syntax rules for Yaksha
- Test webui library (to be introduced to runtime at a later stage)
- Additional experiments with thirdparty c libraries that would be a great fit for `Yaksha/runtime`
- Reasonably sized project to experiment on.

## Why use this editor?

- It's a text editor with syntax highlighting for Yaksha.
- Autosave feature.
- Autocomplete for library input.

## Why Not to use?

- You are probably better off using your favorite text editor.
