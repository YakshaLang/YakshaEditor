## Why did I build it? ü§î

- Monarch/Monaco syntax rules for Yaksha
- Test webui library (to be introduced to runtime at a later stage)
- Additional experiments with thirdparty c libraries that would be a great fit for `Yaksha/runtime`
- Reasonably sized project to experiment on.

## Why Not to use?

- You are probably better off using JetBrains IDE (such as CLion with Yaksha plugins) or vs code.
- Just a text editor.
